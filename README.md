# Building for prpl-server
To run the build:
```
npm run build:prpl-server
```
This will populate the server/build/ directory:

```
server/
├── build/
|   └── es5-bundled/
|   └── es6-bundled/
|   └── esm-bundled/
|   └── polymer.json
├── app.yaml
├── package-lock.json
└── package.json
```

# Previewing prpl-server
To preview the build using prpl-server locally:
```
npm run serve:prpl-server
```
#Deploying prpl-server
After building, the contents of server/ contains all the files and configuration necessary to run the app in production. The provided server/package.json specifies server dependencies and the start command which can be used on almost any hosting service that supports Node.js.

# PWA Starter Kit

This sample app is a starting point for building PWAs. Out of the box, the template
gives you the following features:
- all the PWA goodness (manifest, service worker)
- a responsive layout
- application theming
- example of using Redux for state management
- offline UI
- simple routing solution
- fast time-to-interactive and first-paint through the PRPL pattern
- easy deployment to prpl-server or static hosting
- unit and integrating testing starting points
- documentation about other advanced patterns.
